### A basic survey web application made using Nodejs and Reactjs with custom data persistence.

## Features:

- Creating a survey.
- Taking a survey.
- Getting results of a survey.
- A survey should consist of questions, each having yes/no (true/false) answers.

- I did not add delete api yet(you didn't order it)

## How to run the project:

- navigate to a proper directory and open your terminal there.
- Clone the project by executing the following git command:

```
git clone "https://github.com/melbesnard85/mel-survey.git"
```

### The node backend:

- Once finished, we need to start our backend server. In order to do that, we navigate to the backend folder from the inside of our cloned repository folder with the following command:

```
cd .\backend\
```

- We now will load the backend's node modules via npm like this:

```
npm i
```

- After all node modules are loaded we can start our server using the node command like this:

```
node server.js
```

- All set now the backend is up and working.

### The react app:

- open a new terminal window on the "frontend" directory and download the dependencies:

```
npm i
```

- Once all dependencies are downloaded, run the next command to start the app:

```
npm start
```

- All done. Enjoy creating and taking surveys.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
